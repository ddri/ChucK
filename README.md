# ChucK
ChucK is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation.

# Note
This is an adaptation of an idea from a CalArts example of ChucK. I wanted to use a sinewave sweep from 0 to 20,000 Hz as a non-scientific test of what frequencies I can no longer hear in my headphones (Beyerdynamic DT770's I use to produce and engineer music on). 

# Instructions

Warning: to protect your hearing, only run this at low volume the first time. Run at your own risk. 

1. Download ChucK.
2. Run the miniAudicle app it installs.
3. Download the SinewaveSweep.ck file in my repo (or just copypasta).
4. Click on the `Run Virtual Machine` button in the main UI.
5. Click on the `+` symbol in the UI of the Shred editor.
6. Refer to the log to get a sense of where your frequency perception begins to dip.

# Study

I've found a course on Kadenze teaching ChucK which looks great, and will use that to add structure to ongoing explorations.
