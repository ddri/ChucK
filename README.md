# ChucK
ChucK is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation.

# Note

I wanted to adapt an idea from a CalArts example of ChucK to use a sinewave sweep from 0 to 20,000 Hz as a non-scientific test of what frequencies I can no longer hear in my headphones (Beyerdynamic DT770's I used to product and engineer music on). Refer to the file for more info.
