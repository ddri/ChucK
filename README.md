# What is this repo?

This repo is a place for me to track both my personal explorations and my coursework in studying ChucK.

ChucK is a programming language for real-time sound synthesis and music creation.

# Study

I've found a course on Kadenze teaching ChucK which looks great, and will use that to add structure to ongoing explorations.
