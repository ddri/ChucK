# Sinewave Sweep

This is an adaptation of an idea from a CalArts example of ChucK. It sweeps a simple sinewave from 0 to 20,000 Hz.

# Why?

Human hearing ranges from a theoretical range of 20 to 20,000 Hz. Although in reality we exprience less than this, and the top end drops off as we age. So for fun, I wanted to hear this and listen for the upper range my ears can currently hear. 

I say "for fun" as this isn't diagnostic as much as an interesting reference. Partly for me personally as a former touring musician in an electronic music live act, where the high volume exposure of regularly playing clubs and festivals definitely has a cost. 

I also found this interesting to compare response patterns of variosu audio monitors, headphones, and speakers around the studio and home. It may prove interesting to you also, but keep in mind you do so at your own risk.


# Instructions

Warning: to protect your hearing, only run this at low volume the first time. Run at your own risk. 

1. Download ChucK.
2. Run the miniAudicle app it installs.
3. Download the SinewaveSweep.ck file in my repo (or just copypasta).
4. Click on the `Run Virtual Machine` button in the main UI.
5. Click on the `+` symbol in the UI of the Shred editor.
6. Refer to the log to get a sense of where your frequency perception begins to dip.

# Warning

Use this at your own risk. Be careful with your hearing if you are using headphones and don't scare your neighbours too much.
